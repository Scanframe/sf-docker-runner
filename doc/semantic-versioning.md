# Semantic Versioning {#semantic-versioning}

## Conventional Commits Auto Version Bumping

To automatically bump the version using conventional commits, the [build.py](../bin/build.py) script provides
a subcommand for it.

The script analyzes the commit messages up-to a certain commit and computes a new semantic version.
At the same time generates release-notes for this version.

```bash
# List all
./build.py version info
```

## Commit Message Format

The Conventional Commit format is based on [ConventionalCommits.Org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
and is as follows where the blank lines are separators between description, body and footer.

```
<header>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### A Full Example

Below is a full example of a commit message where the body has multiple paragraphs and the footers are identifiable.

```
feat(compiler): add strict null pointer checking optimizations

The optimizer framework currently treats all pointer arithmetic as potentially
null-unsafe, forcing redundant safety branches into the generated assembly.
This heavily degrades pipeline execution speeds on tight loop structures.

Overhaul the pointer tracking system to identify statically proven non-null
references. This allows the compiler to strip unnecessary branch instructions
during the final code emission phase.

### Header

The **header** and the first mandatory line of the commit message has a format as:

```
<type>(<scope>)!: <short summary>
│       │      │      │
│       │      │      └─⫸ Summary in an imperative mood.
│       │      │
│       │      └─⫸ Optional exclamation mark '!' indicating a breaking change.
│       │
│       └─⫸ Commit Scope: common|compiler|config|cmake|changelog|docs-infra|pack|iface|etc...
│
└─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|chore|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|style|test|revert
```

The commit message should be written in an imperative mood, which means it should describe
the action that the commit will perform, rather than the action that has been performed.
For example, "Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug".

### The Body (Optional)

The body provides a detailed description of the change.
The Context: You may use past tense to describe the historical problem or the old state of the codebase.
The Solution: Use the imperative mood when describing the specific actions the new code executes to resolve the issue.

### The Footer (s) (Optional)

```
<token>: <description/value>
 │        │
 │        └─⫸ Description or a value.
 │
 └─⫸ Token without spaces.
```

The footer is reserved for tracking issues (e.g., Fixes: #123) or providing notes on changes.

## Examples of Message Headers

1. `feat(auth)!: Implement a new authentication system.`
	 This message introduces a new feature (`feat`) that likely has backward-incompatibilities (`!`) and might require a
   major version bump.
2. `fix: Update dependency versions to address security vulnerabilities.`
	 This message fixes a bug (`fix`) by updating dependencies,
	 but doesn't introduce new features or breaking changes, so the version should likely remain unchanged.
3. `build(deps): Upgrade build tools to the latest version.`
	 This message clarifies the scope (`build(deps)`) of changes affecting build dependencies and doesn't directly impact
   the project's functionality,
	 so versioning is likely unaffected.
4. `chore: Update project documentation.`
	 This message reflects maintenance changes (`chore`) to documentation and doesn't introduce new features or bugs,
	 so the version likely stays the same.
5. `ci: Configure continuous integration for merge requests.`
	 This message describes changes to the CI process (`ci`), which typically don't affect the project's public version,
   so the versioning remains unchanged.
6. `docs: Add a new tutorial for beginners.`
	 Similar to updating project documentation (`chore`), adding a tutorial (`docs`) doesn't impact functionality and
   likely does not warrant a version change.
7. `style: Fix code formatting issues.`
	 This message addresses code style (`style`), which doesn't introduce new features or fix bugs, so the version
   shouldn't change.
8. `refactor: Improve code readability and maintainability.`
	 While refactoring code (`refactor`) doesn't directly introduce new features or fix bugs, significant improvements
   might influence a minor version bump, but
	 it depends on project specifics.
9. `perf: Optimize performance for large datasets.`
	 Similar to refactoring, performance improvements (`perf`) might warrant a minor version bump for significant
   optimizations, but the decision depends on
	 project context.
10. `test(auth): Add unit tests for a new feature.`
		Adding tests (`test`) is a good practice and doesn't affect the project's functionality or introduce breaking
    changes, so the version likely remains
		unchanged.
